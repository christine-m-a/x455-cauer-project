                Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
                animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
                applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
                including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
                alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily,
                often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods
                derived from some plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal
                grains, but include savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes,
                flowers such as broccoli, and seeds such as pulses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low
                in fat and calories but are bulky and filling. They supply dietary
                fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and
                trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins
                A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is
                found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke,
                cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments. Research has
                shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three
                servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than
                five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of
                developing coronary heart disease or stroke. The nutritional content
                of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of
                protein though generally they contain little fat, and varying
                proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin
                B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.

                Plant scientists have classified fruits into three main groups:
                simple fruits, aggregate fruits, and multiple (or composite) fruits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simple fleshy fruits from apples to berries to watermelon; simple
                dry fruits including beans and rice, coconuts and carrots; aggregate
                fruits including strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw;
                multiple fruits such as pineapple, fig, mulberries; (see above re
                all)â€” are commercially valuable as human food. They are eaten both
                fresh and as jams, marmalade and other fruit preserves. They are
                used extensively in manufactured and processed foods (cakes,
                cookies, baked goods, flavorings, ice cream, yogurt, canned
                vegetables, frozen vegetables and meals) and beverages such as fruit
                juices and alcoholic beverages (brandy, fruit beer, wine). Spices
                like vanilla, black pepper, paprika, and allspice are derived from
                berries. Olive fruit is pressed for olive oil and similar processing
                is applied to other oil bearing fruits/vegetables.
              </p>
              <p>
                Various culinary fruits provide significant amounts of fiber and
                water and present significant resistance to chewing; many are
                generally high in vitamin C. An overview of numerous studies show
                that fruits (e.g., whole apples or whole oranges) are very
                satisfying (filling) in the acts of simply eating and chewing them.
                The fiber consumed in eating fruit promote satiety and help to
                control weight gain and to provide cholesterol-lowering effects.
                Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced
                risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with
                aging. A current review for meta-analyses concludes that even
                current assessments might significantly underestimate the protective
                associations of regularly eating fruits and vegetables.

             Sweet pies may be filled with fruit (as in an apple pie), 
             nuts (pecan pie), fruit preserves (jam tart), brown sugar (sugar pie), 
             sweetened vegetables (rhubarb pie), or with thicker fillings based on eggs

             Cherry pie, for example, is a pie baked with a cherry filling. 
             Traditionally, cherry pie is made with sour cherries rather than sweet cherries. 
             Morello cherries are one of the most common kinds of cherry used, but other varieties 
             such as the black cherry may also be used.

             A pot pie, in US and Canadian dialects, is a type of meat pie with a top pie
             crust that is commonly used throughout the continent,consisting of flaky 
             pastry. Pot pies may be made with a variety of fillings including poultry, 
             beef, seafood, or plant-based meat substitute fillings, and may also differ 
             in the types of crust.
